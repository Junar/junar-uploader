Junar API Publish Module 
========================

The publish method allows to create and update datasets that are on the cloud or on local machines. It allows the use of a GUID to identify pre-existing resources to be updated or to create brand new resources. The file formats currently supported are CSV, XLS, XLSX, KML and KMZ. XML is also supported, but depending on the inner structure of the dataset it could return and error so itâ€™s not recommended to publish through the API.  
  
This document briefly describes the use of the API Publish module through a curl request or [**using our junar uploader tool (recommended)**](#ourtool), the parameters needed and its syntax, error handling as well as providing a sample operation of publishing and updating a resource.
